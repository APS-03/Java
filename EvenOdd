Write a program that's can detect and tell us weather the number given is even or odd. */

Ans. :
import java.util.Scanner;

class Even{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter any Number : ");

        int num = obj.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Number is: " + num); 
        
        if(num%2==0){
            System.out.print("\n The entered number "+ num+" is Even ");
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("\n The entered number is Odd ");
